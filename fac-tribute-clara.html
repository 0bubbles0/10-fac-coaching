      <h3 class="title">Love</h3>
      <h4 class="title">Robert Schumann</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Enchanted by Clara’s playing, Robert left his law studies and became a live-in pupil of her father instead.
        </li>
        <li>As part of his marriage proposal, Robert gifted her his (now famous) piano composition <span
            class="bold-p">“Childhood Scenes”</span>. After
          her father’s refusal, they had to seek a court intervention to be allowed to marry.</li>
        <li>Robert and Clara had 8 children and later moved to Düsseldorf. While Robert was mostly known as a music
          critic
          and
          conductor, it was in fact <span class="bold-p">Clara who was more famous</span> during their lifetimes.</li>
        <li>Clara supported Robert during his mental health struggles, while also raising their children and earning the
          family income through playing and teaching piano. Customary to the times, she was not allowed to visit him in
          hospital during the final years of his life.</li>

      <h4 class="title">Johannes Brahms</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Aged 20, Johannes Brahms joined the Schumann household as a student to Robert. He became the couple’s
          closest
          confidante, all admiring each other’s musical talents.</li>
        <li>During Robert’s illness, Brahms was among the few allowed to visit him in hospital. Throughout and after
          Robert’s
          death, Brahms supported Clara emotionally, in running the household and teaching the children.</li>
        <li>After a refused proposal, they maintained a platonic yet passionate friendship, supporting each other
          artistically
          and <span class="bold-p">corresponding for the rest of their lives</span>, dying within a year of each other.
